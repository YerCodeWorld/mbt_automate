# MBT AUTOMATE - whatever this is

This project is really specific to what it does. It is the automation of a process
from a company that handles transport services for different companies and itself. 
The main logic is built-on reducing time needed to complete certain specific actions
within this process, which fulfill its purpose.

## Creating a broader logic?

The process includes creating different designs for each service, using a singular 
design with some small variations based on service type and company. That was done
manually and something I said no way in heaven when I came up here.
I first used canva bulk but got tired really quickly. So I simply replicated
the design in *HTML* and adapted it to be a functional component I could build multiple 
designs however I wanted.

Maybe someone can find some usefulness to this in some other way, but the logic is to narrow 
to what it does. Also It's pretty safe to say that there's a much better tool to whatever this
could serve to achieve.

If someone finds out something interesting could be made, might that someone be blessed 
and their ideas be heard.
